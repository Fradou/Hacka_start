Hackaton_insead
===============

Hackaton between Wild Code School for the technical part and INSEAD for the business part.  
INSEAD students came with the app idea and WCS students developped it during a 48h hackaton.

The app is called JustAsk and is designed to help foreigner to find a local to be a translator/adviser/negociator in specific day to day situation (opening a bank account, subscribe to an insurance, etc.)
